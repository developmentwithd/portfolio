              Worked on a contract basis to develop and enhance front-end features using React. Built responsive UI
              components, integrated APIs, and collaborated with design and backend teams to deliver user-focused
              web solutions.
              I am working on contract basis. I am also handling data scraping tasks using python and playwright.
